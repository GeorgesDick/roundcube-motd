With this plugin, you can create localized motd. Every time a user successfully logs in, the localized motd will be displayed, until he clicks a "Do not show this page again" checkbox.

But.... If you change the motd file, the new message will be displayed until he clicks a "Do not show this page again" checkbox (and so on).
